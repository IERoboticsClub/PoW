# Papers of the Week



## PoW Series

The IE Robotics Club organizes the AI Paper of the Week, a **discussion on a trending topic related to Robotics or AI**. During the event, we will be reviewing and analyzing a paper on one of these topics and **discussing the most intriguing aspects** of it in depth. Any doubts that may arise during the reading will be addressed.

üìÖ The paper to be discussed will be **chosen one week in advance** by all attendees of the upcoming event and will be published for **individual reading beforehand**.

üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You do **not need to be an expert** in the field or have an in-depth understanding of every concept presented in the paper. If you have a **passion for AI or a general interest in robotics** and wish to learn more, you are welcome to join the discussion as an active participant or simply listen in without any obligation.

‚úÖ To ensure that everyone has access to the information presented during the event, we will **create slides and share them** via Notion. If you are unable to attend, you may access the slides from the **previous session and this week's paper** by accessing here: [Papers](https://www.notion.so/AI-PoW-Series-77071497fa224d2a897e77ec0f4b172a)
